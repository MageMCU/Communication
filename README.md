# Communication Repository

- Communication within embedded circuits and devices is an efficient method to exchange data. The communication protocols like I2C and SPI, UART use a physical circuit... Other digital signals considered include Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)...

## Devices ##

- PWM
    - **PCA9685** communication ***I2C Address 0x40***
        - NXP Semiconductors
            - Device: Adafruit PCA9685 16-Channel Servo Driver
            - Code: Adafruit Industries

## Sensors ##

- Magnetometers
    - **HMC5883L** communication ***I2C Address 0x1E***
        - Honeywell
            - Device: Parallax HMC5883L ()
            - Code: Individual
    - **LIS2MDL**  communication ***I2C Address 0x1E***
        - STMicroelectronics
            - Device: Adafruit LIS2MDL Triple Axis Magnetometer
            - Code: Adafruit Industries

## Testing Platform

- This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.

- **PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 

- **Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.

## Issues

- None
