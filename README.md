# Communication Repository
Communication within embedded circuits and devices is an efficient method to exchange data. The communication protocols like I2C and SPI, UART use a physical circuit... Other digital signals considered include Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)...

## Testing Platform

- This MCU chip **Atmega328P** is well known and the price is affordable as well as most of the robotic hardware that is described here. The Arduino Uno board comes with a removable MCU.

- **PlatformIO** is a cross-platform, cross-architecture, multiple framework, professional tool for embedded systems engineers and for software developers who write applications for embedded products. 

- **Visual Studio Code** is a streamlined code editor and it runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows. The best thing about VSCode, it is free.
